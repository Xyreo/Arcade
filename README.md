The project's front-end interface was developed using Tkinter and Tcl. The communication of room and game events between the server and players is facilitated through a custom TCP-based protocol. User authentication, profile pictures, and statistics are managed using a Flask-powered API. MySQL is utilized to securely store user data and gameplay metrics.
